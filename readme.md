The ident for my BTS videos

four balls bounce in. They bounce off one another and the sides of the box; they come to rest all the same distance apart and close to one another. Then they rotate showing that they've got b-t-s-couk written on them, and then the rest of the screen fades in showing that the balls are actually the big discs on the side of selfridges. The balls should end up being towards the bottom right of the screen, and we see the selfridges curve top left.
